This assignment I learned tree structures and basic operations on trees. I was 
asked to build tree structures from parent-child relations and to implement depth first
and breadth first traversals on those trees.

WordNet1
is a lexical database for the English language. It groups English words into sets of synonyms
called synsets. All synsets are connected to other synsets by means of semantic relations.
There are several different relations between synsets. In WordNet, nouns are organized into hierarchies,
defined by hypernym or IS A relationships. Opposite of hypernymy is hyponymy. A hyponym
shares a type-of relationship with its hypernym. For example, pigeon, crow, eagle and seagull are
all hyponyms of bird (their hypernym); which, in turn, is a hyponym of animal. In this assignment
you will only work with these relations and build small WordNet’s with IS A relations. We will call
these relations superclass and subclass relations in this assignment and use them to perform several
operations on these simple WordNet’s.
